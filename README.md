-   Python 🐍

Beyond these, my curiosity led me to the intriguing world of web3 and Solidity, igniting a passion for distributed systems and blockchain technology. I also delve into the realm of machine learning and reinforcement learning, leveraging these techniques to create innovative solutions such as my [BlackJackAI](https://github.com/RemiPelloux/BlackJackAI) project.

Key Highlights:

-   💼 Lead Web Engineer with hands-on experience in a diverse tech stack.

-   🎓 Aspire to share my knowledge.
-   🌟 Passionate about contributing to and learning from every project I join.

While most of my contributions are private (working on private projects), I'm always open to exciting collaborations and knowledge exchange.

Let's connect and create something amazing together!

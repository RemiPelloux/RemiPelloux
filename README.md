-   Python 🐍

Beyond these, my curiosity led me to the intriguing world of web3 and Solidity, igniting a passion for distributed systems and blockchain technology. I also delve into the realm of machine learning and reinforcement learning, leveraging these techniques to create innovative solutions such as my [BlackJackAI](https://github.com/RemiPelloux/BlackJackAI) project.

Key Highlights:
